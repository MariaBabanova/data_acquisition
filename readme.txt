This project is example for visualization data, using pandas library. In this case we are using .csv and .xlsx files.
NOTE: for using .xlsx files is needed to install xlrd. If it needed paste this command in IDE terminal:
pip install xlrd

Sqlalchemy library helps us to import data from database directly.
